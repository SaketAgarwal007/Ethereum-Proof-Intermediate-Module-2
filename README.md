# Description
This is an intuitive web3 application created using React, Solidity, and the Ethers.js library. It leverages the power of Ethereum networks to provide a decentralized experience for managing planes docking and undocking at an airport. The application is built using Solidity smart contracts, the powerful Ethers.js library, and uses the user-friendly MetaMask wallet extension.

# Technologies Used 🛠️
This project utilizes the following technologies:

Solidity: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the airdock smart contract in this project. Learn more about Solidity.
Ethers.js: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library that provides a concise and consistent API for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions in this project. Explore Ethers.js.
MetaMask: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform transactions in this project. Get MetaMask.
Hardhat: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts. Hardhat is used to compile and deploy the airdock smart contract in this project. Discover Hardhat.

# Installation ⬇️
Follow these steps to get the project up and running 🏗️:

Download or clone the project:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airport-docking.git
cd airport-docking
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the local blockchain using Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat node
Open a new terminal and deploy the airdock contract:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Configure MetaMask to use the Hardhat node 🦊:

Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
Click on the account icon in the top right corner and select "Settings".
In the "Networks" tab, click on "Add Network".
Fill in the following details:
Network Name: hardhat-test-network
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
Chain ID: 31337
Currency Symbol: ETH
Click on "Save" to add the Hardhat network to MetaMask.
Add accounts using private keys from Hardhat for testing 🔑:

In the MetaMask extension, click on the account icon in the top right corner.
Select "Import Account" or "Import Account using Private Key".
In the "Private Key" field, enter one of the private keys provided by Hardhat.
To access the list of private keys, open the terminal where you started the Hardhat local network.
The private keys are displayed as part of the accounts generated by Hardhat.
Click on "Import" to import the account into MetaMask.
Repeat the above steps to add more accounts for testing purposes.
If you need detailed instructions or visual guidance, you can refer to this step-by-step guide on how to use MetaMask with a Hardhat node.

# Usage 🪜
To use the application, follow these instructions:

After connecting MetaMask to the Hardhat local network, connect your wallet with the application.
You can dock or undock planes using the provided input fields and buttons.
Enter the plane address in the input field and click the "Dock Plane" button to dock a plane.
Click the "Undock Plane" button to undock a plane.
Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
The plane details will be updated, showing the hanger number and the plane address.
Contract Details 🔗
The smart contract used in this project is named airdock and is located inside the contracts/airdock.sol file. It allows users to dock and undock planes at the airport. The contract emits events for successful docking and undocking operations.

# Configuration ⚙️
The hardhat.config.js file is used for configuring the Hardhat development environment. It specifies the Solidity version and required libraries to deploy contracts on the Hardhat node.

# Scripts 📜
The deploy.js script, located in the scripts folder, is used to deploy the airdock contract. It uses Hardhat's ethers library to interact with the blockchain. This script is executed with the npx hardhat run command.
